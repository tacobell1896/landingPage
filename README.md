LandingPage

This is a template to make a lightweight but effective landing page using HTML and CSS. There is also some javascript in here to handle making the slide images rotate, but this will not need to be touched.

To change your color scheme of the landing page, make sure you change the colors (hex value works best) in the header class in main.css as well as the h2 color in main.css. Changing the color of the header class will change the background color of the bar on top of the card class. Changing the color of the h2 element will change the color of the link that is on the bottom of the page.

To change the images, please rename the images you want to logo.png for the logo, background-image.jpg for the background image, and then slide-1.png for the first slide image and slide-2.png for the second slide image.

If there are any style changes that you would like made, feel free to make an issue of it in GitHub or contact the author at tbell.swd@gmail.com. He will consider any suggestions and try to make them as soon as possible.

For any questions feel free to email at tbell.swd@gmail.com. Emails will most likely be responded to within 24 hours.
